# Time_Series_Forecasting
Performed extensive EDA on global city-level temperature data to identify seasonal patterns, anomalies, and long-term trends using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn; derived key KPIs such as monthly means, temperature anomalies, and hemisphere-wise trends.
Developed an ARIMA-based time series forecasting model after thorough stationarity checks (ADF test) and parameter tuning using ACF/PACF plots; predicted future temperature values with performance evaluation and visual comparison.
Automated feature engineering for time series analysis, including extracting seasonality, creating time-based indices (month, season, hemisphere, latitude band), and handling datetime formatting, missing values, and index frequency alignment for accurate modeling.
